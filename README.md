# Missense Mutation

Program for modification of proteins on atomistic level. Program MisMut can be used in order to modify the sequence of amino acids in the initial protein to the predetermined sequence.

There are two input files: 
* input file with initial protein in pdb format;
* input file containing the predetermined structure of the output protein in two possible formats, in extended format with three letter code for amino acids, or short form of one letter for 20 possible amino acids.

The result of the program is new pdb file containing new protein with predetermined sequence of amino acids.

The program can be used in combination with [Pulchra](https://www.pirx.com/pulchra/index.shtml) program in order to generate all-atom protein structure from reduced protein model and then modify sequence of the protein.
